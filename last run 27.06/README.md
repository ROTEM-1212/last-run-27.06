## 1. Overview

The project is an end-to-end pipeline for **multi-label classification of PTSD symptom indicators in Hebrew-language text**, with a focus on the informal register used by Israeli military veterans (WhatsApp messages, tweets, Reddit posts, diary entries — frequently containing military slang).

The classifier targets **8 symptom categories**, derived from DSM-5 criteria for PTSD:

| Label | Clinical Construct (DSM-5) |
|---|---|
| `intrusive_memories` | Recurrent, involuntary intrusive memories / flashbacks |
| `avoidance` | Avoidance of trauma-associated stimuli |
| `hypervigilance` | Hyperarousal — exaggerated startle, scanning for threat |
| `sleep_disturbance` | Insomnia, nightmares, disrupted sleep |
| `anger_irritability` | Irritable behavior and angry outbursts |
| `emotional_numbing` | Persistent inability to experience positive emotions |
| `guilt_shame` | Persistent negative emotional state, self-blame |
| `functional_impairment` | Clinically significant impairment in daily functioning |

Records may carry zero labels (**hard negatives** — text that superficially resembles a symptom report but does not meet criteria), which the model must learn to reject.

**Clinical significance:** informal self-disclosure of PTSD symptoms (in peer support forums, messaging apps, or personal writing) is a low-friction signal that could support **early triage and screening** at scale, particularly for populations underserved by formal clinical assessment. Because labeled real-world clinical text in Hebrew is scarce and sensitive (privacy, IRB constraints), this project develops the dataset synthetically, then validates that synthetic distribution against real-world data before training.

### 2.1 Synthetic Data Generation (Stage 1)

Real clinical-grade Hebrew PTSD self-disclosure data is not available in sufficient volume to train a supervised classifier, and collecting it directly would raise privacy and ethical concerns. The dataset is therefore generated synthetically:

- **Generator:** `src/data_generation.py::generate_dataset()`, backed by an LLM (OpenAI API, with an Ollama/local-model and mock fallback for offline runs).
- **Clinical anchoring:** each generated example is conditioned on a specific DSM-5 sub-criterion (`dsm5_criterion` field), and on a hand-curated bank of Hebrew clinical-language and military-slang markers per label — these are coded directly in `DSM5_CRITERIA` rather than left to the LLM to invent at generation time.
- **Controlled variation axes:** every record varies along `platform` (`whatsapp`, `tweet`, `reddit`, `diary`), `explicitness` (`explicit`, `implicit`, `behavioral`), `severity` (`mild`, `medium`, `strong`), and `example_type` (`positive_clear`, `implicit`, `hard_negative`, `ambiguous`), to ensure the resulting classifier sees realistic surface-form diversity, not just clean DSM-5 language.
- **Hard negatives:** ~25% of the dataset (`example_type = "hard_negative"`) consists of text that is superficially similar to a symptom report but does not meet clinical criteria (e.g., generic fatigue with no traumatic referent). These carry `labels: []` and are essential for training a classifier that discriminates true symptom language from surface-level lookalikes.
- **Output:** `data/dataset.json` — a flat JSON array, one record per synthetic utterance, with full label/metadata schema.

### 2.2 Realism Test (Stage 3.5)

Before any annotation or training effort is invested, the synthetic corpus is checked against real human-written text to catch distributional or stylistic drift early.

- **Method:** `src/validation.py::run_realism_test()` runs a **forced-choice discrimination task**: for each trial, one real sentence (from `data/golden_dataset.json`, scraped from a relevant Reddit community via `scrape_reddit.py`) is paired with one synthetic sentence, and an LLM judge is asked to identify which of the two is real.
- **Metric — detection rate:** the fraction of pairs the judge correctly identifies. A detection rate near chance (**0.50**) indicates the synthetic text is **indistinguishable** from real text to the judge; a detection rate approaching 1.0 indicates the synthetic text is easily flagged as artificial.
- **Decision rule:** a configurable `flag_threshold` (`REALISM_FAIL_THRESHOLD` in `src/config.py`) marks the dataset as failing realism if the detection rate exceeds it — i.e., if the synthetic text is *too easy* to tell apart from real text.
- **Output:** `artifacts/realism_test_results.json`, containing `total_pairs`, `correct_guesses`, `detection_rate`, `flagged` (boolean), and the full per-pair trace (texts, positions, judge guesses) for qualitative review.

### 2.3 Data Annotation & Inter-Rater Reliability (Stage 3.5b)

To validate that the synthetic labels assigned at generation time are actually recoverable by independent human readers (i.e., that the labeling task is well-defined and the text is not ambiguous to the point of being unlabelable):

- **Export:** `src/validation.py::export_for_annotation()` produces `data/annotation_export.csv` — a de-identified, label-stripped version of a dataset sample for blind annotation.
- **Process:** two independent annotators label the export by hand against the 8-category schema, producing `data/annotation_rater1.csv` and `data/annotation_rater2.csv`.
- **Agreement metric:** `src/validation.py::compute_cohen_kappa()` computes **Cohen's Kappa** per label (binary present/absent agreement for each of the 8 categories independently, since this is a multi-label — not multi-class — task) plus a macro-average across labels.
- **Interpretation:** Kappa corrects raw percent-agreement for the agreement expected by chance. Conventionally: `<0` no agreement, `0–0.20` slight, `0.21–0.40` fair, `0.41–0.60` moderate, `0.61–0.80` substantial, `0.81–1.00` almost perfect (Landis & Koch, 1977).
- **Output:** `artifacts/kappa_results.json` — per-label Kappa plus `macro_avg`. This is a manual, on-demand step (not run automatically by `run_pipeline.py`), since it depends on human annotation being completed first.

### 2.4 Model Fine-Tuning (Stage 5)

`src/modeling.py::run_modeling_pipeline()` trains and evaluates the classifier on the stratified split, benchmarking against two reference points:

| Model | Role | Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| **GPT-4o-mini** | Zero-shot baseline | OpenAI structured-output API call, no gradient updates, no Hebrew-specific tuning |
| **SBERT (fine-tuned)** | Multilingual reference | `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`, fine-tuned with a linear multi-label classification head |
| **AlephBERT (fine-tuned)** | Primary model | `dicta-il/alephbertgimmel-base` — a BERT-family encoder pretrained natively on Hebrew, fine-tuned with a sigmoid multi-label classification head |

Both fine-tuned models use a **binary cross-entropy** objective over independent per-label sigmoid outputs (standard multi-label setup), trained for `10` epochs at `lr=2e-5` (`ALEPHBERT_EPOCHS`/`ALEPHBERT_LR` in `src/config.py`), with a held-out validation split (`VAL_SIZE=0.15`) carved from the training fold for early-stopping/model selection. A simpler **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression** baseline (`class_weight="balanced"`) is additionally computed during EDA (Stage 3) as a non-neural sanity check.

The rationale for benchmarking a native-Hebrew encoder (AlephBERT) against a multilingual encoder (SBERT) and a strong general-purpose LLM (GPT-4o-mini) is to isolate how much of the performance gap is attributable to **Hebrew-specific subword tokenization and pretraining**, versus general language understanding capacity.

### 2.5 Results & Evaluation (Stage 5/6)

All three models are scored on the same held-out test split (`data/test_dataset.json`) using standard multi-label metrics — micro/macro Precision, Recall, and F1 — plus a per-label F1 breakdown to surface which symptom categories are hardest to detect. Misclassified examples are exported to `artifacts/misclassified_errors.xlsx` for qualitative error analysis. See [Section 5](#5-results) for the full results tables.

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.10**
- (Optional, recommended) CUDA-capable GPU for AlephBERT/SBERT fine-tuning
- An OpenAI API key (for Stage 5's GPT-4o-mini baseline and/or Stage 1's default LLM-backed generation)

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone [Insert Repository URL]
cd ptsd_pipeline
```

### Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv

## 5. Results

### 5.1 Realism Test (Synthetic vs. Real Text Discrimination)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total pairs evaluated | 47 |
| Correct judge guesses | 24 |
| Detection rate | 51.06% |
| Flag threshold | 85% |
| Flagged as unrealistic? | **No** |

A detection rate of ~51% is statistically indistinguishable from chance (50%), indicating the LLM judge could not reliably tell synthetic utterances apart from genuine human-written Hebrew trauma-disclosure text — the dataset passes the realism gate.

### 5.2 Inter-Rater Reliability (Cohen's Kappa, per label)

| Symptom Label | Cohen's Kappa |
|---|---|
| `sleep_disturbance` | 0.887 |
| `anger_irritability` | 0.853 |
| `avoidance` | 0.772 |
| `hypervigilance` | 0.677 |
| `intrusive_memories` | 0.494 |
| `emotional_numbing` | 0.432 |
| `functional_impairment` | 0.200 |
| `guilt_shame` | 0.000 |
| **Macro-average** | **0.539 (moderate agreement)** |

> **Note:** agreement is strong-to-substantial for high-frequency, behaviorally explicit labels (sleep, anger, avoidance) and weak for low-frequency, more inferential labels (`guilt_shame`, `functional_impairment`) — see [Limitations](#7-limitations).

### 5.3 Model Performance (Held-Out Test Set)

| Model | Accuracy | Precision (micro) | Recall (micro) | F1 (micro) | F1 (macro) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GPT-4o-mini (zero-shot) | 0.459 | 0.555 | 0.945 | 0.700 | 0.688 |
| SBERT (fine-tuned) | 0.760 | 0.844 | 0.912 | 0.877 | 0.838 |
| **AlephBERT (fine-tuned)** | **0.897** | **0.960** | **0.931** | **0.945** | **0.931** |

### 5.4 AlephBERT — Per-Label F1

| Symptom Label | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sleep_disturbance` | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 |
| `anger_irritability` | 1.000 | 0.957 | 0.978 |
| `intrusive_memories` | 0.953 | 0.976 | 0.965 |
| `hypervigilance` | 0.990 | 0.941 | 0.964 |
| `emotional_numbing` | 0.925 | 0.925 | 0.925 |
| `avoidance` | 0.912 | 0.861 | 0.886 |
| `guilt_shame` | 0.921 | 0.814 | 0.864 |
| `functional_impairment` | 0.853 | 0.879 | 0.866 |

**Headline result:** the fine-tuned, Hebrew-native AlephBERT model outperforms both the multilingual SBERT baseline (+9.3 F1-macro points) and the zero-shot GPT-4o-mini baseline (+24.3 F1-macro points), supporting the hypothesis that native Hebrew subword pretraining materially improves clinical symptom detection over multilingual or general-purpose LLM approaches in this low-resource setting.

## 7. Limitations

- **Fully synthetic training data.** Despite passing the realism test (Section 5.1, N=47 pairs), the training corpus contains no real clinical text; residual synthetic artifacts not captured by the realism test's sample size may still bias the model.
- **Low inter-rater agreement on inferential labels.** `guilt_shame` (κ=0.00) and `functional_impairment` (κ=0.20) show weak human agreement, suggesting these categories are conceptually harder to apply consistently — model performance on these labels should be interpreted cautiously regardless of headline F1.
- **Realism test sample size is small** (47 pairs) relative to the full dataset (2,000 records); detection-rate estimates carry non-trivial variance.
- **No external/held-out clinical validation.** Performance is reported solely on a stratified split of the same synthetic distribution used for training; no real-world deployment cohort has been evaluated.
- **Single annotator pair.** Kappa is computed between exactly two raters; it does not capture broader population-level annotator variance.
